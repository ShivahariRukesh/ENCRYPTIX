          The man who can be throned with the name of descendant of God Avatar
          Nikola Tesla (born July 9/10, 1856, Smiljan, Austrian Empire [now in
          Croatia]â€”died January 7, 1943, New York, New York, U.S.) was a Serbian
          American inventor and engineer who discovered and patented the
          rotating magnetic field, the basis of most alternating-current
          machinery. He also developed the three-phase system of electric power
          transmission. He immigrated to the United States in 1884 and sold the
          patent rights to his system of alternating-current dynamos,
          transformers, and motors to George Westinghouse. In 1891 he invented
          the Tesla coil, an induction coil widely used in radio technology.
          Tesla was from a family of Serbian origin. His father was an Orthodox
          priest; his mother was unschooled but highly intelligent. As he
          matured, he displayed remarkable imagination and creativity as well as
          a poetic touch.

        dsdsdsd dsdsdsdsds dsdsdsdsds dsdsdsd aa asd Alternating current, flow
        of electric charge that periodically reverses. It starts, say, from
        zero, grows to a maximum, decreases to zero, reverses, reaches a maximum
        in the opposite direction, returns again to the original value, and
        repeats this cycle indefinitely. The interval of time between the
        attainment of a definite value on two successive cycles is called the
        period, the number of cycles or periods per second is the frequency, and
        the maximum value in either direction is the amplitude of the
        alternating current. Low frequencies, such as 50 and 60 cycles per
        second (hertz), are used for domestic and commercial power, but
        alternating currents of frequencies around 100,000,000 cycles per second
        (100 megahertz) are used in television and those of several thousand
        megahertz in radar or microwave communication. Cellular telephones
        operate at frequencies of about 1,000 megahertz (1 gigahertz). For
        decades, alternating current (AC) had the distinct advantage over direct
        current (DC; a steady flow of electric charge in one direction) of being
        able to transmit power over large distances without great loss of energy
        to resistance. The power transmitted is equal to the current times the
        voltage; however, the power lost is equal to the resistance times the
        square of the current. Changing voltages was very difficult with the
        first DC electric power grids in the late 19th century. Because of the
        power loss, these grids used low voltages to maintain high current and
        thus could only transmit usable power over short distances. DC power
        transmission was soon supplanted by AC systems that transmit power at
        very high voltages (and correspondingly low current) and easily use
        transformers to change the voltage. (However, current DC systems can
        easily change voltages.) Current AC systems transmit power from
        generators at hundreds of thousands of volts and use transformers to
        lower the voltage to 220 volts (as in much of the world) or 120 volts
        (as in North America) for individual customers. See also electric
        current.
